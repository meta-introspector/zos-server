# Value Lattice Research Hypothesis

## The Monster Group Symmetry Conjecture

**Hypothesis:** Markov paths from 0 to any value in a computational system exhibit symmetries isomorphic to the Monster Group.

**Known Facts:**
- We have 0 (absolute zero point)
- We have 1 (unity) and other target values
- Instructions can start from 0
- Every Markov path from 0 to target has enumerable path p
- All such paths can be catalogued

**Research Questions:**
1. Do these paths form a group structure?
2. What symmetries emerge from path enumeration?
3. Is there a connection to sporadic groups like Monster?
4. What is the natural "energy unit" for transformations?

**Current Status:**
- **Evidence Level:** Gut feeling + theoretical possibility
- **Research Phase:** Hypothesis formation
- **Next Steps:** Enumerate paths, analyze symmetries
- **Conclusion:** Unknown - requires investigation

**Value:** Even if Monster Group connection is wrong, the path enumeration and symmetry analysis will reveal the true mathematical structure of computational transformations.
